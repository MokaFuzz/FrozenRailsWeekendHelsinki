FrozenRailsWeekendHelsinki
==========================

Coaches and Organizers get together after Frozen Rails in Helsinki! 

Hi all! 

The COW needs to be organised as low-key as possible as resources at our end are really scarce right now. 

Suggested program: 
-Frozen Rails 11-12.9 
-Weekend 13-14.9

Frozen Rails can give a limited amount of discounted tickets for attendees of the weekend. 
Kisko can give a code so people can purchase tickets on their own..


Saturday 13th we will organise a meetup for all, depending on the amount of people, 
either within Helsinki as a picknick / low-key evening nearby Helsinki on the countryside. 
Sunday would be casual with a brunch or so. 

Accommodation should be looked at by everyone on their own, but for people who this causes a problem 
(if a shared airbnb or alike is too expensive), 
there are some people in Helsinki who are willing to accommodate / co-working spaces with showers etc, 
so some 10 people could be accommodated with friends. 

IF YOU NEED HELP FOR ACCOMODATION / WANT TO SLEEP ON SOMEONE'S FLOOR OR COUCH TYPE YOUR EMAIL HERE: 






Names of people who are committed to coming and who have purchased tickets (either plane or Frozen Rails): 
Linda Liukas
Henrietta Kek채l채inen 
Vesa V채nsk채 
Konstantin Haase 





We'd love to have as many as possible here, 
but it's difficult to promise to arrange activities before the final (committed) number of people is clear :)


Hugs H 

ps any special wishes email henrietta @ railsgirls .com, I probably won't answer them in a few weeks though.
